# 2021OttwaGreenspacesComparisons
Code in this repositorty is a result of my summer CO-OP at UOttawa LAGISS in the summer of 2021, as well as code forked from https://github.com/laggiss/OttawaGreenspacesComparisons.

See Example.ipynb for example code of setting up the dataset, training a model, and running the model on pulled images from the Mapillary v4 api.

The model can be run on any bounding box of coordinates.
